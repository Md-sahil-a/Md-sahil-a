Facing my family, her absence is a relentless torment, a burning abyss that leaves me shattered, gasping for the love that should be here but isn't. 

Ya Allah you know everything but why why why ! i thought this time she won't do again but she has done the same thing, give me the peace please !


 bacha  you should have to be with me when i'm facing just for you, but you only care about yourself, 
 do whatever you want.....
